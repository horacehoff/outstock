This projects allows you to save your files on discords servers and make you able to retreive them using a personal weekhook.

All of the files are stored between your own prive and personal discord server and the links to download them will be in the "history" file stored locally on your machine but can be shared to allow access to others to your files.

```diff
- BEWARE !!!

- Do not delete your "history" or the links to your files might be permanetly lost and wont be able to be retreived.
